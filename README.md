# Django Backend Application with REST-APIs

A Django web application that can have multiple python apps.

Personal AI Agent:

Our platform is an AI-backed web based application, where users can:

Search: local information like, tourist places, places of interest, history of place etc.

Our model will be trained on local history, geography, news, trends etc.
Products Aggregator: search and place orders for food (like Zomato), products (like Amazon, Myntra) etc.

Businesses are registered with us, we must have info. of all the registered and unregistered businesses running in the city. Businesses can be manufacturers, Distributors, Traders, Restauraunts etc.

For food businesses, users order on our platform and we fulfil the orders by outsourcing the food preperation, and we do the delivery, what we get is the sales and marketing commission. This way we save on time and resources for inventory, preperations etc.

To get the business data we can use google Maps APIs, Zomato, Swiggy, MCA website.

Services Aggregator: search and avail various services like salon, house-maids etc.

We will have to onboard all the service providers of the region like CAs, Doctors, Househelp, Carpenters etc.

Initially we can start by referrals to earn revenue.

To get the business data we can use google Maps APIs.

Recommendations: Users must get recommendations based on their search and behaviours.

Advertisements: Once we have enough DAU we can earn revenue from advertisements.
